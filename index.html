					<p>I am a full-stack developer that helps bring customers to businesses by creating responsive websites with customers in mind. My projects include  high-quality designs, easy-to-use user-interfaces, and integrated, fully-functional server-side back end development. Throughout the process, I use semantic markup that is well documented and easy to read, ensuring your website can be easily maintained and scaled as your company grows. I also have extensive experience efficiently managing projects and successfully working with clients and colleagues. By having the full scope of your project in mind, I can save you time and money and simplify the process of working together, while producing a well-considered cohesive website.
					</p>
					<p>I have a diverse set of skills ranging from HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to .Net, C#, Search Engine Optimization, Relational and NoSQL databases, and API development. If you'd like to find out more about my work, take a look at some of my <a href="portfolio.html">projects</a>. Then, <a href="contact.html">leave me a message</a> so we can discuss your current project and how I can help you achieve your goals.
